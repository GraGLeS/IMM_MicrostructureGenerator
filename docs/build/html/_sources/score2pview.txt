How to import SCORE .bin files into Paraview?
=============================================

By default, little endian is assumed. Then **.raw** files generated by SCORE can be imported readily into Paraview
as shown in the following screenshots:

0. Paraview is an open source visualization and analysis software (http://www.paraview.org/). 
1. Load the corresponding raw-file with the Paraview binary RAW importer
2. Interpret as little endian, unsigned int, extend 1, a cubic domain of size N x N x N cells is imported by [[0,N-1], [0,N-1], [0,N-1]
3. Data origin is lower front left.
4. When the structure is rendered as **GrainID** a simple thresholding of grains of possible. 
5. This applies as well for importing grain boundaries data.
6. Inverse polefigure coloring encodes each cell as a combination of three 1B unsigned char (R,G,B).
